Most research recommends 150-300 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise per week, or roughly 20-40 minutes of cardio each day. Running, walking, cycling, and swimming are just a few examples of cardio workouts. Studies show that the more aerobic exercise people get, the more body fat they tend to lose.
